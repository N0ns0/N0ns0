👋 Hi, I’m Nonso, I am on a journey -- transitioning to tech from finance. 

👀 I’m really enthusiastic about learning programming and specializing in Web development...
 
🌱 I’m have learnt SQL and have beginner knowledge of python but my main goal is to learn Java, CSS and HTML
 
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that would help me learn and develop these skills...
 
📫 Outside the world of tech, I am always looking for ways to gain new skills, i am an avid believer that no skill is a waste, so I learn at every opportunity from scottish Ceilidh to  chinese egg fried rice..
